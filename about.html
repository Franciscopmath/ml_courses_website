        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Senior Expert Data Scientist with over 10 years of combined experience in both
          industry and academia, I am a seasoned professional in the eld of retail. From my
          academic background to my real world contributions, I have always sought to bridge
          the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical solutions. My professional
          motivations are rooted in the search for transformative change. Over the years, I have
          successfully led and contributed to various projects that leveraged my background in
          automation with computer vision, visual search and others. My journey has seen me
          collaborate in the national project of pricing where I effectively leveraged IBM Cloud
          Pak for Data to deliver results that have had a tangible impact. This ability to seamlessly
          blend academic rigor with real-world application has allowed me to not only stay at the
          forefront of industry advancements, but also consistently deliver measurable value to
          the organizations I've been a part of.
